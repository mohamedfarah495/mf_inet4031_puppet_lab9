# Puppet Lab 9

This project includes my Puppet code for Lab 9 in INET4031.

There are three parts:

- Part 1: Creates a file using Puppet
- Part 2: Adds users and groups using Puppet
- Part 3: Sets up a LAMP stack (Apache, PHP, MariaDB) with Puppet

All Puppet manifest files are in this folder. I used `puppet apply` to test each part on my Ubuntu VM.

This repo was made for class. Everything was tested and working as shown in my screenshots. Exept the SSH into user05, user06, and user07 wasn't working.
